# Election-Oracle
This project employs machine learning techniques to predict election exit poll results based on demographic and contextual factors. By analyzing historical voting patterns and voter attributes, the project aims to develop accurate predictive models to forecast election outcomes. Utilizing supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and gradient boosting, the project explores various approaches to enhance prediction accuracy. The predictive models are evaluated using key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The insights derived from this project have significant implications for political campaigns, policymakers, and analysts seeking to understand and influence voter behavior in elections.
