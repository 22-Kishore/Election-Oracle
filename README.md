# Election-Oracle
Overview

This project aims to predict election exit poll results using machine learning algorithms. By leveraging demographic data and historical voting patterns, the goal is to develop accurate predictive models for forecasting election outcomes.

Features

Data aggregation and preprocessing: The project collects and cleanses diverse electoral data sources to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

Model selection and evaluation: Various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, LDA, Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging, and Gradient Boosting are evaluated for their predictive performance.

Comparative analysis: The project compares the performance of different models based on metrics such as accuracy, AUC, recall, precision, and F1 score.

Decision support: Insights generated from the predictive models can inform strategic decision-making for political campaigns and policymakers.

Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

Run the main script or Jupyter notebooks to execute the analysis and predictions.

Usage

Data collection: Provide instructions for obtaining or accessing the dataset used in the project.

Preprocessing: Outline the steps involved in preprocessing the data, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling.

Model training: Detail the process of training the machine learning models, including hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

Evaluation: Explain how model performance is evaluated using various metrics and techniques.

Prediction: Demonstrate how to use the trained models to make predictions on new data or unseen election exit poll data.
